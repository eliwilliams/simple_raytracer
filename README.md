# raytracer

An implementation of a simple and inefficient ray tracer in Java. This project makes use of JOGL, a (Java specifc) binding for the OpenGL API.

This tracer now features support for sphere and triangle models defined in the .xml files included in the repo.
Additionally, ambient, Lambertian and Blinn-Phong shading coefficients are included in the renders.
Support is yet to be added for reflection and refraction, so that is why some xml files do not render properly.
